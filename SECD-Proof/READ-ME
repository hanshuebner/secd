This directory contains all of the sources for the SECD microprocessor
study.  The sources are compatible with HOL version 2.1.

The only changes necessary to build this proof at any other location
are believed to be the following:

  1. Change the absolute pathname for Hol in the first line of each of
     the files:
	 ./Makefile
	 ./wordn/Makefile
	 ./buses/Makefile

The files in this directory consist of the following:

  Makefile		the top level makefile

  wordn/		a library directory containing the definition and
   			partial axiomatization of a nonempty finite size
			word data type (written by Tom Melham - tfm@cl.cam.ac.uk)

  buses/		a set of theorems and tactics to help with proofs
                        of concerning objects of the underlying type upon
                        which the wordn type is build

  TACTICS/		a directory with an assortment of specialized tactics 
			used in the proof

  hol-init.ml		the initialization file for hol, containing
			definitions required for the execution of the
                        sources, and setting up the search path as needed
 
  modulo_ops.ml		defines modulo arithmetic operations, and develops
			the theory of the operations

  val_defs.ml		defines the abstraction functions from bus'es to
                        num's and int's

  cu_types.ml		defines the wordn data types used in the control
                        unit, as well as subfield selector functions, and
                        an increment function on word9 

  dp_types.ml		defines the wordn data types used in the
			datapath, as well as wordn constants, subfield
        		selector functions, and wordn constructor functions

  abstract_mem_type.ml 	defines an abstract data type to represent the
			state of lisp structures in memories, and a
			set of primitive operations thereon

  interface.ml		defines a one_asserted property, used by both the
			control unit and datapath sections

  io.ml			defines i/o functions for reading the file "intermediate"
			(written by John VanTassel: jvt@cl.cam.ac.uk)

  intermediate		a compiled intermediate form of the microcode
			program, used to generate a rom function definition
  
  rt_CU.ml ,rt_DP.ml, rt_PADS.ml, rt_SECD.ml, rt_SYS.ml
  			register transfer level definitions of the system
			hierarchy 

  top_SECD.ml		top level definition of the system

  val_theorems.ml	develops theorems about the val abstractions

  Inc9_proofs.ml	develops a full suite of theorems about the
			incrementation of word9 values

  CU_wordn_proofs.ml 	proves some equality and inequalities of wordn constants

  CU_proofs.ml, DP_proofs.ml, SECD_proofs.ml, SYS_proofs.ml
			unfolding of definitions, and simplifications to the 
			rt level of description

  constraints.ml	defines the constraints on the correctness proof

  when.ml		temporal abstraction predicates (written by Inder S.
			Dhingra - esd@cl.caam.ac.uk)

  mem_abs.ml		defines an abstraction between low level and abstract
			memories 

  phase_template.ml	a template for substitution used by phase_proof_fcn

  phase_proof_fcn.ml	a function for proving the "phase" level theorems

  phase_lemmas1.ml ... phase_lemmas7.ml
			develops theorems about the effect of execution of 
			individual microinstructions

  mu-prog_level.ml	proves theorems used in the microprogramming level

  loop_proofs.ml	develops a number of theorems about val abstractions and
			iterations used in proving the effect of computing while
			loops 

  mu-prog_proof_fcn.ml  a function for proving "microprogramming" level theorems
  mu-prog_proof0.ml	proves that under given constraints, the system initially 
			reaches the idle state

  mu-prog_init_proofs.ml proves the top level finite state machine transition
			sequences, except for the machine instruction exectutions

  mu-prog_sr_proofs.ml proves theorems about the effect of executing subroutines

  mu-prog_ADD.ml ... mu-prog_SUB.ml
			develops theorems about the effect of execution of 
			microinstruction sequences for each machine instruction.
			This is the microprogramming level.

  simplify.ml		converts theorems from the microprogramming stage to 
			more readable forms by use of let bindings.  This part
			is not used subsequently in the proof, but was useful to
			examine intermediate results for planning later stages
			of the proof.

  liveness.ml		proves that under given constraints, the system has a
			"liveness" property

  correctness_misc.ml	develops results about the invariance of data structures
			under primitive operations and constraints.

  correctness_init.ml	proves the correspondence of the top level fsm
			transitions (aside from machine instruction exectution)
			at the rtl and top levels.

  correctness_ADD.ml ... correctness_SUB.ml
			proves the correspondence of the rtl and top level 
			transitions for each machine instruction

  correctness.ml	proves the correspondence of the rtl and top level
			systems under given constraints
